The SQL project aimed to analyze a restaurant's database to derive valuable insights into menu items, customer behavior, and order patterns. The methodology involved querying and analyzing the menu_items, orders, and customer behavior tables to uncover key findings that could inform business decisions.

Key objectives:

Analyze the menu_items table to understand the menu composition, pricing, and category distribution.

Explore the orders table to identify order patterns, date range, and customer behavior.

Provide actionable insights to improve menu offerings, optimize pricing, and enhance customer experience.

The insights derived from the analysis help the restaurant make data-driven decisions to enhance its menu, pricing, and overall customer experience, ultimately leading to improved profitability and customer satisfaction.
